What is LeGACY Project
For my self, it is another step in learning how to create a MMORPG game server objects.

Finally we have some progress here, so we can manage to import some codes to the repository.

Please feel free to check them out...

in order to compile on Linux, you will need some of these: libssl-dev, libmysql++-dev, gnulib, libpth-dev, zlib, libZThread and some others dev-tools installed on your system.


Also, there is another similar server project, its located here, http://code.google.com/p/tsprivateserver/ and the development progress it's preety fast. It's running under Win32 platform. It's interesting.
